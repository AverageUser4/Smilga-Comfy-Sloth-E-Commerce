- add end to end tests
- check Dialog component and places it is used in for accessibility issues
- add products list to checkout: product name (color) x(count) - price
- if product overflows in ProductInCart (has count > stock) the overflowing count is subtracted FROM STOCK
eg. count: 14, stock: 10, ends up being count: 6 - may investigate why this happens and if it happens consistently,
but not allowing overflow to happen may be enough
- add sync between open tabs using messagins api etc
- logging in/out in Profile component breaks focus trap (because the 'last focusable' element is changed)
- store user in localStorage because sessionStorage is different for each tab
