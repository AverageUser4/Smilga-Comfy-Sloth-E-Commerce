- add end to end tests
- improve existing tests
- screenreader (orca) for some reason reads only yes and no button when opening logout Dialog, the rest of Dialog components works fine
- if product overflows in ProductInCart (has count > stock) the overflowing count is subtracted FROM STOCK
eg. count: 14, stock: 10, ends up being count: 6 - may investigate why this happens and if it happens consistently,
but not allowing overflow to happen may be enough
- logging in/out in Profile component breaks focus trap (because the 'last focusable' element is changed)
- add code splitting
- Checkout component flashes 'you have to login' and 'nothing in your cart' messages for brief moment before it shows expected content,
it is caused by data from AuthContext and CartContext not being loaded immediately, should use isLoading for this page and check
other pages for similiar issues
- add alternative sizes for images
