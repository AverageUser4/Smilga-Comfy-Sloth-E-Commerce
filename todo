- add end to end tests
- improve existing tests
- revise CartContext tests, make use of describe blocks as the file is pretty complex
- screenreader (orca) for some reason reads only yes and no button when opening logout Dialog, the rest of Dialog components works fine
- if product overflows in ProductInCart (has count > stock) the overflowing count is subtracted FROM STOCK
  eg. count: 14, stock: 10, ends up being count: 6 - may investigate why this happens and if it happens consistently,
  but not allowing overflow to happen may be enough
- logging in/out in Profile component breaks focus trap (because the 'last focusable' element is changed)
