- css clean up:
  - ideally there should be no css modules for pages
- ProductInCart: change layout to table
- add alt attributes to icons used in buttons without text (if there are any)
- make proper use of accounts:
  - cart for a given account should be saved to localStorage
  - when you have something in cart as guest and then login
    it should be added to the cart of the account you've logged in to
  - merging carts: 
    - fetch data of all products
    - if amount is exceeded notify the user
    - existing cart for profile overrides non-logged cart
      (3 red sofas for guest and 3 purple sofas for users: 
      it will choose 1 red sofa and 3 purple sofas if there are only 4 sofas available)
- analize and decide whether or not certain PropTypes should use isRequired
- data of products is immediately fetched in CartContext, should make it so its only fetched when needed
