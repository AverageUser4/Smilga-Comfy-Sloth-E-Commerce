- add end to end tests
- improve existing tests
- screenreader (orca) for some reason reads only yes and no button when opening logout Dialog, the rest of Dialog components works fine
- if product overflows in ProductInCart (has count > stock) the overflowing count is subtracted FROM STOCK
eg. count: 14, stock: 10, ends up being count: 6 - may investigate why this happens and if it happens consistently,
but not allowing overflow to happen may be enough
- logging in/out in Profile component breaks focus trap (because the 'last focusable' element is changed)
- add code splitting
- revise CartContext tests, make use of describe blocks as the file is pretty complex
- images from one page are fetched even if they are not needed anymore:
  - may need to throttle internet speed to see that
  - go to products page
  - all 23 images are being fetched
  - choose single product (or any other)
  - the 23 images are still being fetched, which makes page load slower
  - it is not caused by useFullImageLoad, seems like SPA thing or browser thing
