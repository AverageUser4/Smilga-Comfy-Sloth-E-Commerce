- css clean up:
  - ideally there should be no css modules for pages
- ProductInCart: change layout to table
- create useFetch hook, used by  both useProductData and useProducts
- add alt attributes to icons used in buttons without text (if there are any)
- make proper use of accounts:
  - cart for a given account should be saved to localStorage
  - when you have something in cart as guest and then login
  it should be added to the cart of the account you've logged in to
- analize and decide whether or not certain PropTypes should use isRequired
