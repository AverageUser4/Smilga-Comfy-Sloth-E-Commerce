- make cart merging work properly (in CartContext)
- add end to end tests
- check Dialog component and places it is used in for accessibility issues
- add products list to checkout: product name (color) x(count) - price
- if product overflows in ProductInCart (has count > stock) the overflowing count is subtracted FROM STOCK
eg. count: 14, stock: 10, ends up being count: 6 - may investigate why this happens and if it happens consistently,
but not allowing overflow to happen may be enough
- cartMergeGuestWithUser ideally should not remove items form cart of the user (only from guest if needed), but it does when:
  - user cart:
    - product A (stock 3):
      - color: red
      - count: 1
    - product A:
      - color: green
      - count: 1
  - guest cart:
    - product A:
      - color: red
      - stock: 2
  - outcome cart:
    - productA:
      - color: red
      - count: 3
  - the one with green color gets removed, because its later in the array
