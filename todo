- 'skip to content' is buggy
- css clean up:
  - ideally there should be no css modules for pages
- ProductInCart: change layout to table
- AllProducts: there should be way to show more detailed product component
- create useFetch hook, used by  both useProductData and useProducts
- make controls in products browser sticky
- toggle-buttons in ProductsGridTop could be changed to radio inputs
